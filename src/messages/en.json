        "acVsDc": {
          "question": "What's the difference between AC and DC charging?",
          "answer": "AC charging uses alternating current and goes through the vehicle's onboard charger. It's suitable for longer parking (at home, at work) with power of 3.7–22 kW. DC charging delivers direct current directly to the battery, enabling fast charging with power of 50–400 kW – ideal for traveling and short stops."
        },
        "installationTime": {
          "question": "How long does charging station installation take?",
          "answer": "Installation of a home wallbox station typically takes 2–4 hours. For corporate installations with multiple stations and electrical modifications needed, expect 1–3 days. DC fast chargers require more extensive preparation and installation can take several days including construction work."
        },
        "homeCharging": {
          "question": "Can I install a charging station at home?",
          "answer": "Yes, home charging is the most convenient way to charge an electric vehicle. For installation, you need sufficient electrical connection capacity (minimum 3×25A for an 11 kW station). We recommend consulting with our technician who will assess your electrical installation options."
        },
        "chargingCost": {
          "question": "How much does charging an electric vehicle cost?",
          "answer": "Charging costs depend on electricity price and battery capacity. With home charging at €0.20/kWh, charging a 60 kWh battery costs approximately €12, which corresponds to a range of 300–400 km. With solar panels or night tariffs, costs can be even lower."
        },
        "warranty": {
          "question": "What warranty do you provide on charging stations?",
          "answer": "We provide a standard 3-year warranty on all MyBox stations. Under warranty, we ensure free service and replacement of defective parts. We also offer extended warranties and service contracts for corporate customers with guaranteed response times."
        },
        "cloudPlatform": {
          "question": "What does the MyBox cloud platform enable?",
          "answer": "The cloud platform provides remote monitoring and station management, consumption and cost overview, access rights configuration, automatic billing and integration with accounting systems. We also support dynamic load management for optimal use of available connection capacity."
